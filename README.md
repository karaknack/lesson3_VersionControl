## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. To commit, you need to remember to have files in your project folfer. If you don't it'll say that there are no files to commit.
2. Commiting files is just taking snapshots, and you are able to access these at any time.
3. Version control systems are very helpful, especially because it makes it easy to determine when and where a mistake was made.
