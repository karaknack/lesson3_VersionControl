            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
            With version control systems, you can revert back to different files in previous states. It also allows you to see who modified something last and compare changes over time. There are 3 types of
            version control systems. First, local version control systems have a simple database that keeps all changes to files locally. Centralized version control systems have one server that contains all files and a number of clients that check out files from that one specific
            server. It is easier to administer, but if the server goes down, no one is able to save changes on the project. If the hard disk becomes corrupted/damaged, everything is lost. Distributed version control systems allow clients to fully mirror the snapshots of files instead of just checking out the latest version. If the
            server dies, the repositories can still be restored. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Linux kernel is a large open source software project which began using a distributed version control system named BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, the developers of Linux kernel and the company that developed BitKeeper fell apart. The creator of Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds then began to develop his own tool based on the knowledge gained and lessons learned from BitKeeper. The goals of the new project included speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. Git, born in 2005, is easy to use, and still contains
            the previously mentioned qualities.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate. That means that generally no other information is needed from another computer
            on your network. The entire history of the project is on the local disk, and when Git reads the history, the suer receives it almost instantly. The main thing to remember about Git is that Git has
            three main states that files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data us safely stored in the local database. Modified means that the user has changed the file but has not committed it to the database. Staged means
            the user marked a file in its current version to go into the next commit snapshot. There are also three main sections of a Git project.
            The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata abd object database for the project. The working tree is a single checkout of a version of the project. The staging area is a file from the Git directory that stores information about what will go in the user's next commit.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To get a Git repository, you can either 1. take a local directory that us currently not under version control and turn it into a Git repository, or you can 2. clone an existing repository on your local machine. If
            you have a project directory that you want to start controlling with Git, you simply have to go into that project's directory. The directory contains all of the necessary files by creating a new subdirectory named .git. 
            If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository, the command to use is git clone. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">First, go to the GitHub website and set up an account. You will need to provide a unique username and password, along with your e-mail address. After all that information is entered, click the :Sign up for GitHub" button.
            At this point, your account is all set up, and you can begin connecting to Git repositories using the http:// protocol. However, 
            if you would like to use SSH remotes, you'll have to configure a public key. You got to Settings, click the 'SSH Keys' button, and then click 'Add SSH Key'. After that, you're ready to roll. </p>
